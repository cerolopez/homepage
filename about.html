          <h3 id="tagline">Hi, I'm Cecilia</h3>
          <p>I'm a professional with 10+ years of experience in editorial and website management, 
            currently in the process of transitioning to a career in CS after earning a Master's degree 
            in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Silicon Valley.</p>
            <p>My primary areas of interest include HCI, web dev and design, and UX/UI. I'm secondarily 
              interested in AI, NLP, and large language models.

        <div class="card-content">
            <p>During my undergrad, I remember being drawn to computer science, but being intimidated by the math. 
              It didn't come naturally to me and I didn't have the confidence to keep at it. I decided instead to pursue a Bachelor's in 
              Linguistics, another passion of mine. After graduating in 2014, I found a job as a Content Editor and since then have been working in 
              similar roles.
            </p>
            <p>In 2019, I was excited to learn that you could earn a Master's in Computer Science without a background 
              in CS through the Northeastern Align Program. Being surrounded by such brilliant research scientists and 
              engineers at Meta (where I worked back then), I was inspired to go for it. In August 2021, I decided to apply 
              at the last minute, got accepted about a week later, and enrolled the next month.
            </p>
            <p>For about a year, I continued to work full-time at Meta while in grad school 
              full-time. However, my time at Meta came to an unexpected end when I was let go in the first round of 
              layoffs at the end of 2021. Although I was devastated, I took this opportunity to focus my full attention on finishing school. I 
              graduated in May 2024 and since then have been working part-time so I can focus on shifting careers.
            </p>
            <p>I am looking forward to inspiring the next generation of engineers the same way that my colleagues 
              at Meta inspired me. In particular, I'm passionate about showing other folks underrepresented in tech that 
              if I can do it, they can do it, too.
